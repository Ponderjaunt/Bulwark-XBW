## Project Bulwark
>Bulwark will be an experiment in liquidity provisioning for digital asset ecosystems. Liquidity measures the availability of assets to a market or individual - Bulwark provides access to a secure stream of liquidity by acting as omnidirectional market maker. Where someone might see risk, Bulwark sees reward; the only variable is time. Time is the one constant that makes things hard to change without others noticing - with enough time, anything is possible, the universe is a great example.
### About Bulwark
>Bulwark (XBW) is a token issued on the XRPL which grants access to Bulwark. Bulwark represents an IOU issued on the XRPL. All assets on the XRPL are represented as issued currencies, which are digital balances that represent currency or assets of value held by an issuer. The XRP Ledger has a system of directional accounting relationships, called trust-lines, to make sure that users only hold issued currencies from counterparties they trust - Bulwark = XBW is only available on the XRPL.
#### XRPL
>XRPL is short hand for the [Ripple Ledger](https://xrpl.org/) which runs on the [Rippled Library](https://github.com/ripple/rippled) developed by [Ripple](https://ripple.com/) and used the xRapid(XRP) digital asset as a settlement vehicle.
#### Gateways
>Gateways are entities that link the XRP Ledger to the rest of the world. An existing, or new, online financial institution can expand its services to act as a gateway on the the XRP Ledger. By enabling its users to send and receive value in the XRP Ledger, the gateway increases its value proposition to customers granting access to digital wallet services including transactions and payments. Bulwark can use XRP Ledger-related services to offset expenses and distributes profits back to the trustees after the offset of expenses normally incurred by validating transactions through consensus on the XRPL.
#### Trust-Lines
>Trust-Lines establish credit based on [Issued currencies](https://xrpl.org/issued-currencies.html) on the XRP Ledger and often represent value held by others in the world outside the XRP Ledger. The address that issues those funds in the XRP Ledger is expected to pay the balance back, outside of the XRP Ledger, when users redeem their XRP Ledger balances by returning them to the issuer. There are two cases where you can hold a balance on a trust line that is *greater* than your limit - when you acquire more of that currency through [trading](https://xrpl.org/decentralized-exchange.html), or when you decrease the limit on your trust line. Bulwark trades for the user - so that profits are distributed back as a debit to the holder of XBW. Since a trust line occupies space in the ledger, [a trust line increases the XRP your account must hold in reserve](https://xrpl.org/reserves.html). This applies to the account extending trust, not to the account receiving it.
Pooling reserves to offset the individual risk profile of one liquidity provider allows Bulwark to diffuse risk through the entire liquidity pool. This is based on [Rippling](https://xrpl.org/rippling.html#rippling).
Each trust line is specific to a given [currency code](https://xrpl.org/currency-formats.html#currency-codes). Two accounts can have any number of trust lines between them for different currency codes, but only one trust line in either direction for any given currency code - in this case XBW. You can have multiple trust lines of the same currency code as long as they are from different issuers. For example, a wallet can have Gatehub {USD} and Bitstamp {USD} trust-lines on same account.
